# IIT_Final-Assignment_course-1
EDA using python on the iris dataset.


The course I took this summer is called "Programming for AI and Data Analytics". This was a part of a 5 course , 6 mo long, Post graduate program offered on Coursera by IIT Roorkee. Program was called "Post Graduate Certificate in Data Science & Machine Learning"

Our final assignment was to explore seaborn (or matplotlib) library for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the iris dataset. You can see the example of a pairplot and heatmap of correlation below.
